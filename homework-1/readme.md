## Assignment 1 

### Websites vs Web Applications
Websites are more or less pages on the internet to read, while web applications have dynamic user interactions. While a web application can technically be a website, it often heavily integrates code to create a personalized experience, or allow for tasks to be completed. Most social medias, for instance, function as web applications, versus forums or blogs which are by definition websites.

### VS Code & Extensions
Visual Studio Code is one of several integrated development environments that can simplify the programming experience. It has a wide range of features at its base, but more functionality can be added by installing extensions. In order to do so, go to the 4-squares icon on the left side and get what you need.

### Version Control, Git, and GitHub
Version control allows multiple contributers to work on one project independently, and git is an integration of version control. It allows for rollback and "pulling" changes from the main project to an individual project, and multiple different versions of the project can be maintained at once through branches. GitHub is a service that hosts repositories so that code, assets, etc. can be pulled.

### Markdown & Documentation
Markdown is a simple markup language using symbols to format text. It is used in several websites and web apps due to its ease of use and readability, and does not require you to use tags. Markdown uses **two asterisks** (**) to bold text, _a single underline_ (_) to italicise text, and
- uses
- hyphens
- to
- make
- lists,
among many other things.
