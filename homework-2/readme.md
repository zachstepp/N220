## Week 2

### Weekly Recap

This week marks first contact with HTML files and scripting. There are two methods to making scripts in HTMLs: inline or external. Inline scripts are executed within the HTML, while external scripts are executed from a JavaScript source file. Also, basic console commands were introduced, such as console.log(), console.warn(), and console.clear().
