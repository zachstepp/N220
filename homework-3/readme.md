## Week 3

### Weekly Recap
This was an introduction to declaring variables and using operators in JS, the big three flavors being numbers, strings, and booleans. Note that declaring variables using var is a sin and should never be done lest you want to face the wrath of the graders. Here are some useful variable functions that will definitely be used later:

- `.slice(start, end)`: slices up a string from the starting index to the end index.
- `.replace(old, new)`: replaces the old substring with the new substring
- `.length`: returns the length of a string
- `.split(seperator)`: makes a string into an array based on a seperator
- `.toFixed(digits)`: rounds a number to the set ammount of decimal places
- `Boolean(value)`: converts a value to a boolean. Have fun with truthy vs falsy values!

Also, know the difference between a STRICT comparison and a LOOSE comparison: a strict comparison uses === or !== and compares BOTH data type and value, while == and != just compares the value, even if they're not the same data type. This can screw you up.
